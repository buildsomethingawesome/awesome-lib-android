## Stuff to make Android programming easier

This project will include some wrappers and facades for the Android API with
a focus on making casual app development easier for amateur programmers.

Future videos on the Build Something Awesome website will demonstrate how
to use this library.  Episodes are archived at
http://buildsomethingawesome.org/archive.html

To include Awesome Lib in your project, make a Maven project and include this
dependency:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.buildsomethingawesome.lib</groupId>
      <artifactId>awesome-android</artifactId>

    </dependency>
